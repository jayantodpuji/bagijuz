## Motivation
As a Muslim during the month of Ramadan, I usually aim to read the entire Quran (30th juz). However, I don't always have the time to finish it before Ramadan ends. Therefore, I often join a group of at least two people.

Each day, we typically aim to finish one juz. The total verses in one juz are divided among the group members. This way, I don't need to read all the verses in one juz by myself, only my portion, and I report back to the group when Iâ€™ve completed my part. With this method, the chances of completing all 30 juz during Ramadan are much higher.

The problem is, at the beginning of each day or the night before, I have to calculate how many verses each person should read in one juz. This takes time because we need to divide it equally among all members. For that reason, I created this helper app.
